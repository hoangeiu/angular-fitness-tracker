# FitnessTracker

Fitness Tracker is an app that help people track exercises they do.
The app is build in Angular, Angular Material and NgRx.
Moreover, I use Firebase to store data and hosting.

Some main high concepts: many parts of Angular, implement Angular Material to style, use NgRx to create a main store and dispatch function to transfer data, use firebase to authentication, authenticated, database and hosting.
